                    "Ugly and pointless karaoke effects on attack names, plus they leave in things like \"yatta\" and \"yosh\" which are perfectly translatable.",

                    "The subs are amazing with great TL Notes, & overall simply amazing. One of the best fansubbing groups I have ever seen. They might even be the very best.",
