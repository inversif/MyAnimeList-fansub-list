                    "Fast and accurate. Does not sub the OP, but then who cares.",
                    "Really glad they took over since A.F.K. is MIA",
                    "Really quick on translations, and usually subbed within the same date of airing.",
                    "better translation and soft subs ftw",
                    "Really messy, and not so good as A.F.K. stupid-looking pictures before the Anime starts. Really... who needs that? I only want good translation and that something they don't have."
