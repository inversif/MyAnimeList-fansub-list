                    "Very good subbing, few mistakes, if any. Great font choice, too.",
                    "They regularly miss words, their timing is sometimes off, and their translation choices are silly and archaic. \n\nThe show is watchable with their subs and, unfortunately, these guys are the best you can get for HnK as of April 2009.",
                    "They create great subs in a relatively small amount of time.",
