                    "No gimmicks. Just straight up solid subbing. Get them unless you are a 10 year old meme-spouting child.",
                    "A JoJo sub by JoJo fans!  A quality and faithful translation.  Too bad it' a one-off.",
                    "Best script, good encoding, always on time",
                    "Needless English slang \"Bollocks\" etc, some shitty Americanisms too like \"It's good!\" while they're playing Rugby",
                    "Better than gg's horrible \"British\" localization, but I don't think it's really necessary to subtitle \"Urrrryyyyyyyyyyy\". Like, really?",

                    "Look... They do average subwork, but calling them genuine fans of the series is absolute bs.. They thought Caesar was Ceaser... Not fans in any sense, they just know their memes.",
                    "Superb release as of episode 10, previous episodes were somewhat subpar, hopefully fixed in a batch to match the current quality. Go for commie if you want the novelty of translated visual SFX. rest suck.",
