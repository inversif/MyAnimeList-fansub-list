                    "I like this fansub group because the subtitles are correct written and very easy to read ^^",
                    "I think this is great translation :)",
                    "They're faster than the other groups and their subs are good.",
                    "Great subs plus fluent jap/korean/eng translator",
                    "It was excellent. That's really the only way I could put it. It'd be nice if the series was completed, but for the episodes that are complete, well done."
