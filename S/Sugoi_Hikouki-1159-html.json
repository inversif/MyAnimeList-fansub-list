                    "Very poor translations--inaccurate wording and placement, and hard subs that are the same font the whole way through. Not recommended for anyone who knows any amount of Japanese, or anyone who takes this movie as a serious piece of art.",
                    "No spelling mistakes as far as I could remember. It feels as if the movie wasn't translated.. like it was an English movie itself. :)",
                    "Very large translation errors that completely change the viewer's perception of what the scene is about at some points.  The same font/colour used throughout."
