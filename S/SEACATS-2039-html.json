                    "The fansubbing that they did for Umineko no Naku Koro Ni was incredibly well done. It followed the visual novel almost to the letter, and is by far the best current group subbing Umineko.",
                    "took them quite long and the editing wasn't smooth enough for that timeframe..",
                    "seriously. look at the fansub name and you'll see exactly why they're the group for this particular anime. in case those who aren't up to snuff... umi=sea; neko=cat. what do you get? umineko=seacats! lol",
