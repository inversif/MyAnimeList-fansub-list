                    "English in the subs flows well, despite some TL mistakes. However, subs were too small, too low in the image, used serif fonts, and color-blended into the background. Also condescending attitudes towards viewers.",
                    "Leaving TL notes for some things which very well could have been translated properly, and leaving the translator's personal comments at places. Sad, because besides that it is a solid translation.",
                    "They added editorial comments like \"this character is so hot\" in the subs.  Asinine.",
                    "TLs are good, but gross .avi and didn't do a DVD release.",
                    "Hardsubbed .avi files make me feel like I went back in the 90s",
                    "Hardly the best subs I've seen, but at least they finished it.",
                    "Very decent subs. Sometimes the translator notes didn't really stay on-screen long enough to read without pausing, but that's not really a major problem.\nThe editorial comments were also fun, though not exactly neccessary. :p",
                    "+1 for good subs, -1 for unfunny TL notes.",
