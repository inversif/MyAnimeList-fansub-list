                    "Great quality subs and usually very quick to release in HD",
                    "Very good release in both speed and quality.",

                    "lack some lines",
                    "Honestly, they were good, but now it's cool to insert 'shit' whenever they can.  I hate to admit it because I dislike YIBIS a lot, but they have taken less liberties than Yonkou with their editing lately.",
                    "All the faggots saying these guys are better than Yibis are lying. While Yonkou are faster - they have inferior subs and A/V quality.",
                    "They are a great group with standards. They release in regular intervals, utilize those specialized fonts we love, and use quality raws for great results. They work hard on translating, especially the OP; contrary to what more profanity-laden users think.",
                    "Aside from being fast with translating an episode, the translation quality is also very good, they don't do it half-assed. I also respect the use of Profane words here and there, it adds to the \"vibe\" of the moment.",
                    "Fastest quality release.",

                    "Good quality and they release it in MP4, so i don't have to waste my time converting it to watch on ps3.\n\nAlso anyone who complains about OP\\Ed translations, Yibis doesn't even do it untill like 5-10+ episodes into the new one.",
