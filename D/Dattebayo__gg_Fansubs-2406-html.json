                    "Downloaded the movie. It lags hell a lot on my media player, bad quality, 1080p avi. Fuck you dattebayo",
                    "Yes",
                    "Didn't translate any of the signs, and they feel fairly important for the plot at times.",

                    "Great, it played smooth with me no lag at all. You guys need real codecs and player to play this awesomeness 1080p i could play it fine with a pentium dual 2.0ghz and integrated graphics all of that \"lag\" is because your comps are shit leave your old ass ",

                    "Stupid people: Get better Codecs for those who lag. Or get a better computer. Also, MKV=/= better quality. I would have preferred it though.\nAside from that, gets a negative because 1080p H.264 only as a 2.73 GB is ridiculous."

                    "Subs are great. And to all those complaining about lag, update your codecs or get a better computer. It's not the subbers fault.",
                    "Great subbing, although the amount of subbing in the movie is lacking just a little.",

                    "I wonder when DB will update its programs as there's absolutely no valid reason to make1080p .avi",
                    "Not even as a last resort. (And no 720p version!? Not all of us can play 1080p!)",
