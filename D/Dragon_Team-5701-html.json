                    "While they are the best for DBS, that isn't saying very much. They take themselves a little too seriously and rush releases out the door without proper effort/QC. They could be a lot better if they took their time and listened to suggestions from fans.",

                    "Great and accurate translators. Although not perfect fan sub group, they give out the best quality Dragon Ball Super subs you can find. Only issue is the speed of release can vary but as of March 2016 they released their stuff as fast as the next 2-3 days"
